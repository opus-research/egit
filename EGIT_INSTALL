EGit Installation

PREREQUISITES

In order to install the Git Eclipse plugin you need to have the following
things.

- Eclipse version 3.8.2/4.2.2 or newer

- Since 4.0 JGit and EGit require Java 7.

- A reasonably recent version of Git itself installed on your platform to
  take care of what the plugin does not yet do or do things that native
  git does better. Some tests have been performed using both Cygwin and MSYS git.
  Both have issues that we need both feedback and patches for.
