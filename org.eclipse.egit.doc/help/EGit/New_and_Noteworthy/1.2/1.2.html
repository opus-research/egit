		<h1 id="New_Features">New Features</h1>
		<h2 id="Improved_decorator_performance">Improved decorator performance</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>An IndexDiff cache and a new resource decorator have been implemented to improve performance of resource decoration.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Support_for_project_rename_and_move_for_some_cases">Support for project rename and move for some cases</h2>
		<p>EGit can now move and rename projects within a repository for a number
			of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
			Eclipse actually destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
			(Platform bug 307140). The bug is only worked around in Eclipse 3.7,
			i.e. forbidden in the UI.</p>
		<h2 id="Option_to_auto-share_projects_on_import_when_located_in_a_working_tree">Option to auto-share projects on import when located in a working tree</h2>
		<p>When the new preference 
			<b>Team &gt; Git Projects &gt; Auto share project located in a git repository</b> is enabled projects which are located in the working tree of a git repository are automatically shared with the Git team provider when the project is imported into the workspace.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Interactive_adding_in_Compare_Editors">Interactive adding in Compare Editors</h2>
		<p>You can stage only part of file and save it in git index. Also reverting selected hunk of code (from git index to working tree and from HEAD to working tree) is supported. For more detailed description you can watch this 
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d94RI9QA-RU" target="egit_external">example movie</a>

		<h3 id="Delete_Branch_Command">Delete Branch Command</h3>
		<p>In the commit graph area, there is a new context menu action "Delete Branch" allowing to delete a branch. It will be enabled if a branch exists for the currently selected commit, which is not checked out. If there is a single branch on this commit, which is not checked out, this action will delete this branch immediately. If multiple such branches exist, a dialog will be shown asking which branches should be deleted. If commits become unreachable on "Delete Branch" a confirmation dialog will be shown to prevent accidental unreachability of commits.</p>
		<h3 id="Show_annotations_from_file_table_in_history_view">Show annotations from file table in history view</h3>
		<p>In the revision details area, there is a new context menu action 
			<b>Show Annotations</b>. On selected files it will open the file in a (read-only) editor and display an annotation ruler with commit and author information ("blame annotations") for each line in a file.
